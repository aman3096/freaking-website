    <h1>This is a website(censored version)</h1>
    <p>And it's freaking perfect</p>
    <h2>What else do you want here?</h2>
    <p>You probably build websites and thibnk it is special in a way that it can have those annoying ads and tons of jQuery which ultimately makes the website slower instead of doing the work.
        Well. the perfect website can have the following features
        <ul>
            <li>Lightweight and fast loading</li>
            <li>Fits well on any size of team</li>
            <li>Looks same on every browser(even IE)</li>
            <li>Conveys the appropriate message</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Well guess what user:</h3>
    <section>You are overdesigning. You probably are just thinking about a particular set of people who can see those things. But think about specially abled person who would not be able to see animations. You need to think on that part as well.</section>
    <h2>It's lightweight</h2>
    <p>This entire page weighs less than the gradient-meshed facebook logo on your fucking Wordpress site. Did you seriously load 100kb of jQuery UI just so you could animate the background color of a div? You loaded all 7 fontfaces of a webfont just so you could say "Hi." at 100px height at the beginning of your site? You better should think of your choices.
    </p>
    <h2>Its responsive</h2>
    <p>You thought that you needed some media queries to be responsive. Turns out that to fit the screen size of the user and not exceed the screen size.</p>

    <h2>Epilogue</h2>
    <p>From the idealogies expressed (poorly) above , <a href="https://simplegroot.netlify.app/">groot-talk</a> was created. you should try to created your own freaking websites</p>
